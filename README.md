## Project Overview



This project focuses on developing a FinTech application that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect fraudulent transactions. In today's world, as the number of online financial transactions increases, so does the risk of fraud. Traditional methods of detecting fraud are no longer effective because scammers have become more sophisticated. To solve this problem, this project uses machine learning algorithms to automatically analyze financial transactions and identify suspicious activities.

The AI system works by learning from past transaction data. It looks at various patterns and features, such as the transaction amount, location, and time, to decide whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. By analyzing large amounts of data, the system can detect even subtle signs of fraud that might be missed by older methods.

This project aims to provide a more accurate, real-time solution to fraud detection. The AI model can quickly analyze transactions and flag potential fraud before it becomes a problem, helping banks and financial institutions reduce losses and protect customers. Additionally, the system is designed to improve over time as it learns from new data, making it adaptable to emerging fraud techniques.



## Features 

**AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models to identify suspicious transactions.

**Real-time Monitoring:** Provides instantaneous fraud classification and alerts.

**Scalability:** Capable of analyzing large volumes of transaction data.

**Automation:** Reduces the need for manual intervention by automating the fraud detection process.

## Data Used

**DATASET AVAILABLE AT**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshikaranjan/fraud-detection/data

The dataset for this project consists of financial transaction records. It includes features such as:

1.)*Transaction Amount*

2.)*Transaction Type*

3.)*Merchant ID*

4.)*User Location*

5.)*Timestamp*

6.)*Label (Fraud or Non-Fraud)*

This data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and perform feature extraction before feeding into the machine learning model.
